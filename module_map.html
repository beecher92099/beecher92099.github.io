    <h2>Bookings vs Forecast</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard shows the weekly bookings versus forecast (cumulative) for the current quarter.
    The forecast for the quarter is broken up into expected weekly amounts based on historical linearity.  As bookings
    come in week-by-week, the dashboard shows whether we are above or below linearity and also includes the capability
    to predict the remaining weeks based on the status of the sales pipeline in Salesforce with configurable 
    assumptions of what percentage of the pipeline will convert to actual bookings.</p>

    <h2>Pipeline Movement Waterfall</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard shows the value of the Salesforce opportunity pipeline at the start of the quarter
    on the left (Initial) along with the Current value of the Pipeline on the right.  A waterfall chart is used to 
    account for all the changes that occurred increasing the value of the pipeline (in green) vs changes which reduced the value of the
    pipeline (in red).</p>

    <h2>Quarter End Pipeline Outcome</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard uses a Sankey diagram to show what eventually became of active pipeline that was 
        present in the
    closing weeks of the quarter.  Each quarter has 13 weeks, so you can for example see what the amount of commit and
    upside pipeline was present at the start of week 13 and then see what became of that pipeline.  Possibilities include
    that the pipeline Booked, the expected book date is Overdue, or was Pushed Out to a later date.</p>
