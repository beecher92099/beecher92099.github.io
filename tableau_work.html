    <h1>Showcase of Tableau Work</h1>
    <p class="description">A brief showcase of some dashboards I've built using Tableau.  These dashboards were built at 
        a previous employer and as such am not permitted to show any screenshots of them, so instead have created mockups in Basalmiq.</p>
</header>

<section class="left-align">
    <h2>Bookings Performance Summary</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard shows the bookings per selected time period (e.g., year, quarter, month, etc.). 
    Different tables are provided to show various breakdowns of the bookings such as by geography, market segment, product area, etc.
    Filters are provided for different dimensions in the data.  Absolute bookings are shown along with YoY change.</p>

</section>

<section class="left-align">
    <h2>Active Subscriptions</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard shows information about Active Subscriptions such as the number of
    subscriptions, number of distinct customers and partners, and annual and total contract values.  Different
    breakdowns as provided such as number of subscriptions including SaaS only products.</p>
</section>

<section class="left-align">
    <h2>Bookings vs Forecast</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard shows the weekly bookings versus forecast (cumulative) for the current quarter.
    The forecast for the quarter is broken up into expected weekly amounts based on historical linearity.  As bookings
    come in week-by-week, the dashboard shows whether we are above or below linearity and also includes the capability
    to predict the remaining weeks based on the status of the sales pipeline in Salesforce with configurable 
    assumptions of what percentage of the pipeline will convert to actual bookings.</p>

</section>

<section class="left-align">
    <h2>Pipeline Movement Waterfall</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard shows the value of the Salesforce opportunity pipeline at the start of the quarter
    on the left (Initial) along with the Current value of the Pipeline on the right.  A waterfall chart is used to 
    account for all the changes that occurred increasing the value of the pipeline (in green) vs changes which reduced the value of the
    pipeline (in red).</p>

</section>       

<section class="left-align">
    <h2>Quarter End Pipeline Outcome</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard uses a Sankey diagram to show what eventually became of active pipeline that was 
        present in the
    closing weeks of the quarter.  Each quarter has 13 weeks, so you can for example see what the amount of commit and
    upside pipeline was present at the start of week 13 and then see what became of that pipeline.  Possibilities include
    that the pipeline booked, the expected book date was pushed out (Overdue), Cancelled/Lost, etc.</p>
</section>    

<section class="left-align">
    <h2>Epic Process Step Analysis</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard uses box plots to compare how long Jira Epics spend in different
    process steps and specifically to compare the Epics from one group (CLPM) with all other Epics to see
    which group is taking longer from a stastical perspective.  There are 6 specific process steps analyzed.  
    Statistics are provided such as Median, Average, Q1, and Q3.  There is the ability to examine a specific Epic
    in detail showing its process steps with start, end, and duration.</p>
</section> 

<section class="left-align">
    <h2>Epic Gantt Chart</h2>
    <p class="description">This dashboard visually shows via a Gantt Chart how long Epics are spending in 
    different process steps, making it easy to quickly spot cases where excessive time is spent or if an Epic
    is going backwards in process steps</p>
