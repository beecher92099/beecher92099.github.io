  <h1>Sample Portfolio for Beecher Adams</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Below you will find links to sample business analytics and data science projects I've worked on.</p>
  <p>We are truly living in extraordinary times.  With the first appearance of ChatGPT in Nov 2022 and the continual improvement
  of these LLMs, the productivity of the knowledge worker has been turbo-charged.  The assistance of ChatGPT
  has dramatically improved how fast I can solve business problems using coding languages I know well such as R, Python, and SQL.  But it has
  also allowed me to develop solutions in code I didn't know well such as web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, etc.).  
  Luckily for us humans, these LLMs can't easily produce the final solution in a single-shot yet, but still often require painstaking back-and-forth effort
  with the LLM helper to achieve the final result.  However, it will be fascinating to watch (and leverage) how AI evolves in the coming years.</p>
